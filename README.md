# NIST-FDD-for-Residential-Air-Conditioners-and-Heat-Pumps
LabView codes, and associated codes, for doing a rule-based-chart method of fault detection and diagnostics

The software, used to process raw data coming from a residential air-conditioner or heat pump that is operating in the cooling mode, is in this repository.  The code was written in LabView 2015/2017 with five main code modules grouped together in a project file.  A technical note will be included in this repository that describes the use of each code module and is meant to accompany a copy of the project code with example files illustrating how each module is used.  All the project files and example files are being made available to the public.
