# NIST-FDD-for-Residential-Air-Conditioners-and-Heat-Pumps
LabView codes, and associated codes, for doing a rule-based-chart method of fault detection and diagnostics
Plus a repository of codes for evaluating the goodness of an FDD algorithm

The software, used to process raw data coming from a residential air-conditioner or heat pump that is operating in the cooling mode, is in this repository.  The code was written in LabView 2015/2017 with five main code modules grouped together in a project file.  A technical note will be included in this repository that describes the use of each code module and is meant to accompany a copy of the project code with example files illustrating how each module is used.  All the project files and example files are being made available to the public.

The FDD Tester Evaluator codes are being stored in this repository for sharing with collaborators and making them easily available for future reference.
